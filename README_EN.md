# Akaunting Jalali Date Module (v2.x)

This module provides full Jalali (Persian) calendar support for Akaunting 3.x. It integrates seamlessly with Akaunting's core and handles date conversions on the client-side for maximum performance.

## ⚠️ The "License Lock" Problem

Since version 3.1.20, Akaunting has introduced a strict licensing mechanism that automatically **uninstalls or deletes** local modules not found in their official App Store.

We reported this breaking change to the Akaunting team, but unfortunately, the issue was deleted without a response. You can view the deleted reference here: [GitHub Issue #3330](https://github.com/akaunting/akaunting/issues/3330).

**To solve this, we provide an automated "Installer & Patcher" to whitelist this module in your core files.**

## Automated Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to install and protect the module from being auto-deleted is using our smart script:

1. **Download** the `installer.php` file from this repository.
2. **Upload** it to your **Akaunting Root Directory** (where your `.env` file is).
3. **Run** the script via terminal:

```bash
   php installer.php
```

**What this script does:**

- Downloads the latest module source.
- Checks and installs Composer dependencies.
- Patches `/app/Traits/Modules.php` to whitelist the module and prevent auto-uninstall.
- Installs and activates the module.

## Manual Installation (Advanced)

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps:

1. **Clone/Download** the module into `modules/JalaliDate`.
2. **Whitelist the module:** Open `app/Traits/Modules.php` and find `if ($alias == 'core') {`. Change it to:

```php
if ($alias == 'core' || $alias == 'jalali-date') {
```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
cd modules/JalaliDate && composer install
```

4. **Activate:**

```bash
php artisan module:install JalaliDate 1
php artisan optimize:clear
```
